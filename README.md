# WGU UPS Program
This was a school project.

# Prompt
I was given two csv files: one contained a table showing the distance between several addresses in a city, the second contained a list of packages that needed to be delivered to the addresses in the table. The object was to deliver the packages in a certain amount of time and under a set mileage. There were some packages that needed to be delivered before a certain time of day, and some packages that arrived to the delivery hub late. There were three trucks that could be used to deliver the packages, but only two trucks could be used at a time.

# Requirements
The application had to be written in Python. I was required to develop my own hashtable to store the package objects.
